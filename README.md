# Javascript-quiz

## Description

My Motivation for building this application was to make a javascript quiz that can track your progress. The reason why i built this quiz was to help others test their knowledge in javascript and improve it by showing their past mistakes. The problem that my quiz solves is that it shows the user's understanding of javascript and the areas they need to work on. What i learned in building this appliaction was how to use the window feature and other advance javascript methods and skills.
